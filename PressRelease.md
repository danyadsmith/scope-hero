There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## The arch nemesis of ScopeCreep

  > For makers who need an effective tool to document and discuss the scope of an app, product or project, ScopeHero is an application that allows users to compile and rate features in terms of impact and effort. 

## Summary ##

ScopeHero converts a popular analog tool called the **Impact & Effort Matrix** into a web application where a project manager or product owner can create an application, document its features, rate the impact and effort of each feature on a scale of 1 to 10, and receive feedback on which features fall into which quadrants. When visualized, the Impact & Effort Matrix is plotted on an x-y axis and contains four quadrants: 

* the YES quadrant: 
    - Low effort/High impact features
* the MAYBE quadrants: 
    - High effort/High impact features
    - Low effort/Low impact features
* the NO quadrant:
    - High effort/No impact features

## Problem ##

When developing a new application or product, it is a common to feel that all features are important and it is difficult to manage scope over the development lifecycle. 

## Solution ##

ScopeHero provides a visual tool that members of the project team can use to rate each feature by impact and effort. During the identification process, the discussions that ensue will help to derive the metrics collected to manage the scope and focus of the project from inception to shipment.
